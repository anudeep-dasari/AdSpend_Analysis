Here are a few noticeable trends.
- It can be seen that results have decreased over time, with the initial results being above the target results till September 7, then we observe that the results fall well short of the desired target results.
- The CPR on the other hand follows the opposite trend with the initial values being low and gradually increasing. The average values of CPR stay close to the target CPR threshold till September &, then increase suddenly to significantly above the threshold and remain pretty constant.
- The Scale score which is derived from and is directly proportional to Results shows the same trend as results with gradually decreasing values.
- The Cost score which is derived from but inversely proportional to the CPR follows the opposite trend to that of CPR with the values staying pretty constant till september 7 and decreasing gradually.

Overall we can conclude that the ads were performing well during the initial period till september 7 (as can be seen from the good scale score and cost scores), then we see a significant dip in the performance (noticeable from the low values of Performance Score and Cost Score)
